     * The selected code snippet in the applyToConsumerDefault class is a method named raised. 
     * This method takes three parameters: r of type Readable, dns of type Runnable, and run 
     * of type Runtime. The method is designed to handle a scenario where r is not null.
     * 
     * Inside the raised method, the code performs the following operations:
     *
     * 1.
     * It sends notifications by invoking the getClass(), hashCode(), and notify() methods 
     * on the r object. These notifications are likely related to object-oriented programming 
     * principles.
     * 2.
     * It initializes three string variables: name, topic, and kits. These variables are used 
     * to represent specific business entities or topics.
     * 3.
     * It calls three private methods: valueObjectRunning(), valuesItemsRunning(), 
     * and valueKits(). These methods are expected to perform some business logic related 
     * to the name, topic, and kits variables. However, the actual implementation of these 
     * methods is not provided in the given code snippet.
     * 4.
     * The @SuppressWarnings("unused") annotation is used to suppress compiler warnings 
     * for the unused variables valuObject, valueItems, and valueKits. This is likely done 
     * to avoid unnecessary warnings during the compilation process.
     *
     * 
     * Overall, the raised method demonstrates a basic structure for handling a specific 
     * scenario within the applyToConsumerDefault class. The actual business logic and 
     * implementation of the valueObjectRunning(), valuesItemsRunning(), and valueKits() 
     * methods are left for the developer to fill in.
