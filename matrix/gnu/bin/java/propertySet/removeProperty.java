     * The selected code snippet is a method named type within 
     * the propertySet.removeProperty class. This method accepts 
     * a RemoteServer object as a parameter and performs various 
     * operations on it.

     * The method begins by invoking methods on the propertyServer 
     * object: equals(), getClass(), getRef(), hashCode(), and notify(). 
     * The getRef() method is likely part of the RemoteServer interface 
     * or its parent classes.
     *
     * Next, the method checks the condition for the propertyServer 
     * object. If propertyServer is not null, it calls the notifyAll() 
     * method on propertyServer.
     *
     * As per your request, the method does not return any additional 
     * code beyond the immediate scope of the code block. It performs 
     * the required operations and handles different scenarios 
     * as needed.
     *
     * This code snippet demonstrates object manipulation and conditional 
     * checks within a method, which is a common pattern in Java 
     * programming.
